# Pipeline Explanation for manual_agent_demo.py

This document outlines how each file is generated in the pipeline. ae30a38d below is a hypothetical run id.

1. **Manifest File (ae30a38d.manifest.json)**
   - Generated by `write_manifest()` in run_logging.py at the start of the script.
   - Contains metadata like run ID, git revision, Python version, platform, timezone, environment flags, and timestamp.

2. **Macro Notes (ae30a38d.macro.notes.md)**
   - Generated by the Macro Analyst agent.
   - The agent's response is saved to `RUN_FILES.macro_notes()` which resolves to `runs/ae30a38d.macro.notes.md`.

3. **Factcheck JSON (ae30a38d.factcheck.json)**
   - Generated by the Fact Checker agent.
   - The fact checker's response and flags are saved to `RUN_FILES.factcheck()` which resolves to `runs/ae30a38d.factcheck.json`.

4. **Executive Brief (ae30a38d.brief.md)**
   - Generated by the Executive Writer agent.
   - The writer's response is saved to `RUN_FILES.brief()` which resolves to `runs/ae30a38d.brief.md`.

5. **Debug JSON (ae30a38d.debug.json)**
   - Generated in the main function after the pipeline completes.
   - Contains debug information like number of search results found, sources files, and errors.

6. **Sources Raw JSON (ae30a38d.sources.raw.json)**
   - Generated by `record_source_jsonl` in io_clients.py during the search process.
   - Contains the raw search results.

7. **Sources Final JSONL (ae30a38d.sources.final.jsonl)**
   - Generated by `record_source_jsonl` in io_clients.py during the search process.
   - Contains the final processed sources in JSONL format.

8. **LLM JSON Files (e.g., ae30a38d.MacroAnalyst.1756069858.llm.json)**
   - Generated by `save_llm_call` in io_clients.py after each LLM call.
   - Contains the request and response details for each LLM interaction.
   - The timestamp (e.g., 1756069858) in the filename is the Unix timestamp when the LLM call was made, ensuring unique filenames.
